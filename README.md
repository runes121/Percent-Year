# Percent-Year
A python application that calculates and shows the progress in percentage points of the year so far. Inspired by the twitter bot https://twitter.com/ProgressBar202_?s=20

This is my little python project that displays a visualisation of the current progress of the current year, it is represented by a progress bar.
